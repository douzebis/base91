# base91

Implementation of the base91 encoding/decoding utility, providing efficient binary-to-text encoding with better space utilization than Base64.

This is Joachim Henke's code "ripped" from https://sourceforge.net/projects/base91/.

A nix derivation has been added for integration with nixpkgs.
